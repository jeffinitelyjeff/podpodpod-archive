    <blockquote>
      Date labels (e.g. "use-by", "sell-by", "best-by", "best if used by," "expires on", etc.) are on a lot of products. Forty-one states require a date label on at least some food product, but there are huge inconsistencies, not just in the wording, but in the meaning of these labels. Some states require them only on dairy, some on shellfish, some on any perishable foods. It's become complicated to decipher these dates, or to know how to act on them, for large retailers and individual consumers alike. And despite what many people assume, they are not about food safety, and were actually never meant to be.

      If you were to walk into Gimlet HQ, there are a few things you’d probably notice right off the bat. First, it’s crowded - like a grungy dorm room. Second, the lighting… it’s not great. Not many windows. Third, it’s white. Really white. 24 of Gimlet’s 27 employees are white. In this episode, we look at diversity (or lack thereof) at Gimlet. And we try to figure out what diversity should mean for the company going forward.

      <description>Fiction podcasts have been on the rise lately, but I&#39;ve found it very difficult to connect to most of them. But The Bright Sessions has hooked me in, with a great mix of intriguing science fiction premise, novel (but very natural) format, and serialization.

Each episode is a therapy session with a supernatural individual learning to deal with their super power (and the first season is following the ongoing sessions of 3 characters). It&#39;s a set of character studies, but it&#39;s also an interesting exploration of the consequences of flashy world-threatening powers on the emotions and turmoils of daily life.

I&#39;m featuring the first episode because it&#39;s definitely worth starting from the beginning, and I hope you get hooked. I&#39;ve really enjoyed the first 6 episodes, and I&#39;m excited to see where this podcast goes.

      Yik Yak is an app that allows users to communicate anonymously with anyone within a 10-mile radius. Last year, we did a story about how it brought out a particularly vicious strain of racism at Colgate University. And in the second half of the show - The past month has seen a flood of similar stories at colleges like University of Missouri, Yale, and Georgetown. So we go beyond Colgate and talk to Jamil Smith of the Intersection podcast to try to understand Colgate in the context of these recent events.

      On April 21st, 1859, an incredible thing happened in London and thousands of people came out to celebrate it. Women wore their finest clothing. Men were in suits and top hats, and children clamored to get a glimpse... of the very first public drinking fountain.

      <description>A look at how Gimlet develops a new podcast idea. I always find it fascinating to learn more about the behind-the-scenes production of NPR-style podcasts. I think as listeners we have a vague sense that &quot;yeah, it&#39;s scripted&quot;, but not really a sense as to how deep that goes; what we see is the tip of the iceberg of the work that goes into these shows. And this episode is particularly interesting because it looks at the creation and development of a new podcast, which is even more unknown and invisible to listeners.

      Gimlet is making a big, expensive bet. The kind of bet that could make or break the company. And it’s a bet that comes down to one factor: What is Gimlet’s competitive advantage? As the company launches its fourth new show, “Surprisingly Awesome,” we take a deep dive in to how the show was made. From the kernel of an idea to the final product. And, along the way, we look at what we believe is Gimlet’s secret formula for making podcasts.

Plus: a look at the long history of savvy political candidates campaigning as Washington "outsiders"; debunking the supposed "Ferguson effect"; and Spotlight, a new movie about the Boston Globe's investigation into the Catholic Church sex scandal, celebrates the power of the press.

      <description>Great chat with hosts of three of the best podcasts about expanding outside your social media echo chamber and broadening your perspective. I often hear that people are fed up with the same discussions over and over again on social media, and I&#39;ve always felt that&#39;s just their own fault for whom they choose to follow (the same goes for podcasts). If you&#39;ve felt like you need a change of pace, this is a great place to start. Also check out the accompanying [blog post](http://www.wnyc.org/story/buzzfeed-professional-internet-readers-break-bubble/) for extra notes and tips that weren&#39;t mentioned on the show.

    <blockquote>
      Some people call it the “echo chamber effect.” Others worry about filter bubbles or homophily. Every once in awhile you'll hear hands wringing over birds of a feather. Or you could just say it like listener Anid Chan in Portland: “I have a concern about personalized feeds. There is so much information out there, but I know that most of what I see are opinions and voices like my own. I worry this makes us more judgmental about other people, because most of what we believe gets emphasized by people who think the same way. How do we break out of the bubble?”

      It's all about nostalgia and limitation as Mike chips away (ahhh?!?!?) at the world of chiptunes music. If you played video games years and years ago, you'll hear a set of sounds that will be completely familiar, even when used in unfamiliar compositional genres. Mike explores the anatomy of chiptunes sounds and composition, and looks into chiptunes' relationship to hacking and the counterculture.

<p>An important look at how police treated a transgender woman in 2009. Even with all the progress we&#39;ve made in transgender rights in the intervening six years, transphobia is still rampant, and this is a brutal look into how it manifests.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Patti Hammond Shaw is a transgender woman. She's legally female on her birth certificate and driver's license, and has been since 1993. But when she was arrested in 2009, male officers strip-searched her in front of male detainees, and held her overnight in a men's cellblock. Patti hired a lawyer and fought back. Her case was instrumental in changing how the police process and detain transgender individuals in Washington, DC.

      <description>I swear one day I won&#39;t feature Radiolab every week, but today is not that day. This episode has two halves: the first is a thrilling and fascinating story about being hacked, and the second is a look behind the network that enables those activities. It&#39;s really great, and totally worth my guilt of featuring the same show three weeks in a row.

      <description>I haven&#39;t read *The Name of the Wind* (though I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s excellent). I&#39;m not a big fan of Cards Against Humanity. But this podcast from Patrick Rothfuss, author of *The Name of the Wind*, and Max Temkin, of Cards Against Humanity, is really great. Their conversations are always interesting, but this episode really struck me with their discussion of the presence—or lack of—logical and well-presented rules behind fantasy magic.

      <description>Part of me feels guilty because this marks my first repeat show recommendation, and in consequent episodes of the podcast nonetheless. But this epiosde was too great to pass up. It takes what may seem like a binary black-and-white issue and explores the nuance, the varied perspectives, to teach us not only about the intricacies of black rhino hunting in Namibia, but how complex so many issues can be.

      <description>The ear-catching (and definitely a bit clickbaity) theory described by this episode&#39;s title is interesting on a micro-level, but not exactly practical. Don&#39;t listen to learn a secret hack you can use to make people like you. Listen to this episode to hear the Cracked editors explore the ramifications of this theory in a fascinating and thought-provoking discusion about society. In particular, the way this theory intersects with and influences inequality is such an adept explanation for how vast inequalities arise, and how society&#39;s natural inclination is to trend towards inequality, rather than against it.

      <description>One of my favorite aspects of the podcast medium is the ability to hear stories from new perspectives, to grow my understanding of the world. As a guy, *Mother: A Podcast* fits that for me perfectly, though I&#39;m sure the podcast would be even more interesting to mothers or women planning to become mothers one day. This latest episode of the podcast is a great collection of stories about pregnancy loss, which I found such a valuable experience because it is something I hear and think about very rarely and I can only begin to understand at a very abstract level.

      Why is it so hard to talk about pregnancy loss? Contributor Miranda Shafer ([http://mirandashafer.com/](http://mirandashafer.com/)) asks some hard questions about how she reacted to her own sister's miscarriage. Amy explores the medical science underlying a case in Indiana where a woman who says she had a stillbirth was convicted of feticide. (Read more about the case here: [http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-03-13/indiana-jury-says-purvi-patel-should-go-prison-what-she-says-was-miscarriage](http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-03-13/indiana-jury-says-purvi-patel-should-go-prison-what-she-says-was-miscarriage)) And a Tumblr project ([http://pregnantparentingprochoice.tumblr.com/](http://pregnantparentingprochoice.tumblr.com/)) collects stories of mothers + soon-to-be moms who support abortion access.

      <description>When the unfortunate news of Oliver Sacks&#39;s passing hit last week, I didn&#39;t know how to react. I had no idea who he was, just that people in public radio really loved him. Apparently Dr. Oliver Sacks provided many stories to *Radiolab* over the years. To honor his memory, *Radiolab* re-aired this episode from July, which is a great conversation with him and really shows why he was so loved.

    <blockquote>
      A decade after Hurricane Katrina, Terri Coleman is teaching a summer class to incoming students at Dillard University—a historically black college in New Orleans. But 10 years ago, when she was about the same age as her students, she was not the kind of kid to get a jump on freshman year with a summer class… Now married with three children and a graduate degree, Terri recently returned to her old neighborhood after spending a few years in Illinois. She tells me about her mixed emotions regarding what’s been lost in the post-Katrina rebuilding of New Orleans. “Clearly I'm here for white hipster game,” she laughs. “But as a class of people, I think they're really dangerous to the city.”

      <description>I&#39;m not a dog person. I might go so far as to say that I hate dogs (except huskies, because wolves). And yet I found this episode all about a puppy psychologist fascinating, engaging, and hillarious.

This was also the first episode of *You&#39;re the Expert* I&#39;d heard, and I&#39;m very impressed. It seems like a really great formula for presenting interesting information with lots of engaging humor.

      <description>John Siracusa is most well-known on the Internet for his library of comprehensive reviews of Mac OS X on Ars Technica, his concluded tech podcast *Hypercritical*, and as one third of the ongoing *Accidental Tech Podcast*. *Hypercritical*, which concluded 2 years ago, is still my favorite podcast—not directly because of any of the topics it covered (though those were usually interesting to tech geeks), but because of the way Siracusa was able to so effectively present and construct arguments about a wide variety of topics. In *Reconcilable Differences*, he and Merlin Mann (another internet figure known in the podcasting sphere for his long-running shows *Back to Work* and *Roderick on the Line*) sit down and try to figure out how each other ticks by sharing stories and philosophies.

The thing is—two white dudes ruminating on life and sharing personal stories sounds like it could be extremely egotistical and utterly unpleasant. But that couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth with *Reconcilable Differences*. This podcast will obviously be more enjoyable if you have some familiarity with the hosts, but I think even people new to these voices will get something out of this conversation, which attempts to tackle the questions &quot;how does John&#39;s mind work, and how did he get that way?&quot;. You&#39;ll get more out of that answer if you have a preexisting fascination with how his mind works, but I think the discussion should be interesting regardless.

And then this episode of *ARRVLS*, an overview of the story behind *How To Be a Girl*, came along and answered that question. This episode is an overview of the story behind *How To Be a Girl*, and a great introduction to the podcast.

    <blockquote>
      “Mommy, something went wrong in your tummy. Put me back so I can come out a girl.” Marlo heard these words from her four-year-old child. Despite being born with male organs, her child has insisted she’s a girl ever since she could form complete sentences. Marlo discusses switching names and pronouns, clothes shopping, supporting her daughter’s decision on whom she does or doesn’t tell, and her own complicated and beautiful experience of having a child she once perceived as a little boy become a little girl.

      <description>A couple months ago while listening to Hello Internet, professional YouTube explainer CGP Grey talked about his reasons for not following the news. He raised an interesting question that left a mark on me: is keeping up with the news as righteous, necessary, and morally imperative as we commonly believe?

This episode of *Freakonomics Radio* grazes that question, but mainly tackles the related question of *why* we actually follow the news, and if it is for the righteousness, necessity, and moral imperatives that we commonly assume. It&#39;s an interesting question, and this podcast does a great job exploring it from multiple perspectives while giving the listener lots to think about.

      <description>You probably may have already seen this coming, but here&#39;s the follow-up to Monday&#39;s episode. If you haven&#39;t listened to the first part of [The Problem We All Live With](http://podpodpodcast.com/featured/4-tal-the-problem-we-all-live-with/), start there first.

**Note:** *This American Life* only keeps a small number of recent episodes available in their podcast feed, which means I suspect this episode will only download normally for about 2.5 weeks after posting. If you want to listen after then, you can listen (along with the rest of their archive) on [*This American Life*&#39;s website](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/563/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-two).

**Similar:** *This American Life* has been hitting it out of the park covering stories about race this year. If you enjoyed this episode, you should *definitely* check out [Cops See It Differently, Part One](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/547/cops-see-it-differently-part-one) (Feb 6, 2015), [Cops See It Differently, Part Two](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/548/cops-see-it-differently-part-two) (Feb 13, 2015), and [Three Miles](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/550/three-miles) (Mar 13, 2015).

**Editorial Note:** I&#39;m unsure how to handle two-part episodes like these going forward. What I&#39;m doing here with devoting 2/3 of the week to one story feels unfair to people who weren&#39;t interested in the first half, but I thought this particular story was gripping enough to warrant the focus. Other alternatives I&#39;ve considered: just post the first episode in the feed, and link to the following parts in the show notes (but I bet a lot of people wouldn&#39;t notice and would completely miss out on the following parts); or include both parts in the feed on a single day (but this contradicts one of my main goals, which is to make this feed light and digestible). I don&#39;t really know. Let me know what you think on [Twitter]({{ site.twitter.jeff_url }}).

What I&#39;m doing here with devoting 2/3 of the week to one story feels unfair to people who weren&#39;t interested in the first half, but I thought this particular story was gripping enough to warrant the focus. Other alternatives I&#39;ve considered: just post the first episode in the feed, and link to the following parts in the show notes (but I bet a lot of people wouldn&#39;t notice and would completely miss out on the following parts); or include both parts in the feed on a single day (but this contradicts one of my main goals, which is to make this feed light and digestible). I don&#39;t really know. Let me know what you think on [Twitter]({{ site.twitter.jeff_url }}).

<p>You probably may have already seen this coming, but here&#39;s the follow-up to Monday&#39;s episode. If you haven&#39;t listened to the first part of <a href="http://podpodpodcast.com/featured/4-tal-the-problem-we-all-live-with/">The Problem We All Live With</a>, start there first.</p>

      Right now, all sorts of people are trying to rethink and reinvent education, to get poor minority kids performing as well as white kids. But there's one thing nobody tries anymore, despite lots of evidence that it works: desegregation. Nikole Hannah-Jones looks at a district that, not long ago, accidentally launched a desegregation program. First of a two-part series.

      <description>Come to *Another Round* to hear two smart women discuss race and social justice; stay for the squirreltalk and insightful interviews. If you&#39;re woke, listen to have fun hearing about issues you care about; if you&#39;re not woke (or don&#39;t know what that word means and think I&#39;m using the past participle of &#39;wake&#39; incorrectly), listen to have fun hearing new voices and seeing different perspectives.

With that general introduction to *Another Round* out of the way, this episode, with guest Audie Cornish from NPR&#39;s *All Things Considered*, is great for all of the reasons that *Another Round* is typically great. Some highlights: reading Martin Luther King quotes to a racist fish, the whiteness of public radio voices, and perspective on microagressions.

    <blockquote>
      By the late 1980s, AIDS had been in the United States for almost a decade. AIDS had be the number one killer of young men in New York City, then of young men in the country, then of young men and women in the country. Despite the gravity of the AIDS crisis, in the late 1980s there was little public acknowledgement of AIDS. A group of artists in Manhattan decided to change that. New York artist Patrick O’Connel would spend days visiting friends in the hospital, going to funerals, and coming home to a panicked answering machine message from friends who just learned they were sick. O’Connel and other artists banded together and started making art in response to AIDS. In 1988 they began calling their collective Visual AIDS. Visual AIDS held public events and organized gallery shows to raise AIDS awareness. But of all the work the group did, they made their biggest impact with a simple little symbol. A little concept that, at the time, was very novel: The AIDS awareness ribbon.
